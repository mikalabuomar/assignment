# Magic 8Ball
## About Magic8Ball
The Magic 8Ball randomly pulls 30 unique phrases from assignment.txt and tries to answer any question you may have (emoticons are included in phrases ðŸ˜Š). Uses builtin modules (time, random).


## Usage
You must have assignment.txt and magic8ball.py in the same directory when running. Otherwise this will not run because the python script willl not find the text file.

```PowerShell
 python .\magic8ball.py
  __  __          _____ _____ _____    ___    ____          _      _
